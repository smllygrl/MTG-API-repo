# MTG-API-repo

Challenge:
You have a client with a huge magic the gathering collection
The client wants an API to keep track of his collection

The API needs to do the following:
- Be able to save card information
- Be able to fetch cards
- Be able to fetch cards by id
- Be able to update cards
- Be able to get card of a specific type using query parameters

Your API should be hosted of either AWS or GCP

Bonus:
Create a devops pipeline using tooling of your choice, so that whenever a change is merged in master, your application is deployed.
Look into spring testing and integration testing and implement tests for your endpoints and services:
